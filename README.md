# chillbot
A Discord bot to chill. This bot was designed to cure boredom during the COVID-19 pandemic. It's still in development and in lack of ideas.
Any suggestions goes to issues, please.

# Running your own version.
*Why'd you run such a crappy bot?* To run your own version of the bot, follow the following instructions.

- Run `npm i` to install the required dependencies.
